### Tasks
All tasks created in TaskForce are immutable. The whole program revolve around Adding and Deleting Tasks. Commands Such as EditCommand
MarkCommands are extension of Addding and Deleting Tasks.

* Adding and Deleting Tasks will trigger an event to inform and update the Model side that the list is updated.
* Having commands revolve around Adding and Deleting simplify our implementation as the Model only have to listen to when Tasks are
added or deleted.

### FindCommand
Our FindCommand is implemented to replace the old ListCommand found in TaskForce. ListCommand simply list out all the tasks found in 
TaskForce and this may become a problem when the list get too big. User have to scroll up and down to locate the specified tasks that they are interested. As such our FindCommand are implemented to allow users to filter out tasks in a few ways.

* Keywords Searched are filtered by TagName, Description and TaskName
* Tasks can be filtered by Event that start/end or are ongoing on a particular day. This include Deadline and Reminders.
* Tasks can also be filtered by Week, showing all the task that is due/ongoing on a particular Week defined as Monday to Friday.

As such our Findcommand covered everything a ListCommand. The key difference is that instead of listing everything on TaskForce,
It allow Users to filter out their list by FindType.


### UndoCommand
We have set a limit for UndoCommand to 10. Users can only undo up to 10 previous command that they have inputted while the program is 
active. Having a ceiling for UndoCommand prevent any form of huge resource hog by TaskForce and this allow Users to multitasks many 
programs with TaskForce opened at the same time.

### SortedList
TaskForce wrap around the ObservableList with a FilteredList, this allow Users to filter out keyword using TaskForce's FindCommand.
The FilteredList is furthur wrapped with a SortedList to ensure the list shown to Users are constantly sorted at all time.
The nature of the ObservableList allow the list shown to be constantly updated whenever a new changes occured such as Addition/Deletion of a new Tasks

### CdCommand
The CdCommand recreate the config.json file using default Config Class as a base. The only difference is that the config.json file will contained the new savepath indicated by users. Any modification made directly to the config.json file will be overwritten when
CdCommand is used.

#### Searching for (a) specific task(s): `find`
Finds tasks of a specific time, or whose names contain any of the given keywords.  
Format: `find METHOD/ KEYWORDS [mark/TRUE]`
KEYWORDS for TYPE 'name/' 'desc/' 'tag/' is a word that is contain/part of a task name/description/tag
KEYWORDS for TYPE 'day' and 'week' is a integer number.

Method | Explanation | Example
-------- | :-------- | :---------
`day/` | List all events/deadline a number of days after today | `find day/ -1` (yesterday)
`week/` | List all events/deadline in a week, after current week | `find week/ 0` (current week)
`name/` | List all tasks with taskName containing the keywords | `find name/ shoes`
`tag/` | List all tasks with taskDescription containing the keywords | `find name/ shoes`
`desc/` | List all tasks with the tags of task containing the keywords | `find name/ shoes`


> * The search is not case sensitive. e.g `task` will match `TaSK`
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `is s task` will match `task is a`
> * Sub-words will be matched e.g. `sk` will match `task`
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

> * FindCommand filtered out marked tasks automatically, user can turn off filter by using [mark/TRUE]
to include marked task in search
* 'find name/i wan to find marked task mark/true'

### Tasks

<img src="images/TaskClass.png" width="500"><br>
Above image is a simplied class diagram of our task class <br>
A task is known as a TASK, FLOATING TASK or REMINDER. <br>
A task is split into three kind, TASK, EVENT and DEADLINE <br>
A BLOCK is treated as a EVENT

All tasks created in TaskForce are immutable. Therefore the whole program revolves around two operations - adding and deleting tasks. As such, advanced commands Such as edit command
mark command are extensions of adding and deleting Tasks.

A OVERDUE task is considered as a EVENT that has end date past today date and is not marked done


* Adding and Deleting Tasks will trigger an event to inform and update the Model side that the list is updated.
* Having commands revolve around Adding and Deleting simplify our implementation as the Model only have to listen to when Tasks are
added or deleted.
* Immutable Tasks simplify the implementation of Undo/Redo since it just the reversal of actions. Deleted task are added back and Added Task are deleted.

### FindCommand
Our FindCommand is implemented to replace the old ListCommand found in TaskForce. ListCommand simply list out all the tasks found in
TaskForce and this may become a problem when the list get too big. User have to scroll up and down to locate the specified tasks that they are interested. As such our FindCommand are implemented to allow users to filter out tasks in a few ways.

* Keywords Searched are filtered by TagName, Description and TaskName
* Tasks can be filtered by Event that start/end or are ongoing on a particular day. This include Deadline and Reminders.
* Tasks can also be filtered by Week, showing all the task that is due/ongoing on a particular Week defined as Monday to Friday.

Nevertheless our FindCommand is also capable of replacing ListCommand Completely through the usage of TYPE/OPTION

* A 'find type/all' will be exactly the same as what listCommand does, showing everything stored in the taskForce storage data.
* A 'find type/mark' will list out every single tasks marked done
* A 'find type/overdue' will list out all deadline that are dued and not marked done.

### SortedList
TaskForce wraps the ObservableList with a FilteredList, this allows users to filter out keyword using TaskForce's FindCommand.
The FilteredList is further wrapped with a SortedList to ensure the list shown to users are constantly sorted at all time.
The nature of the ObservableList allow the list shown to be constantly updated whenever a new changes occured such as Addition/Deletion of a new Tasks

The list are sorted by this order FLOATING TASK --> DEADLINE --> EVENT <br>
Deadline and Event and further sort by dates.

### CdCommand
The CdCommand will recreate the config.json file using default Config Class as a base. The only difference is that the config.json file will contained the new savepath indicated by users. Any modification made directly to the config.json file will be overwritten when
CdCommand is used.

### AddCommand
Our Addcommand is used for adding a FLOATING TASK, EVENT and DEADLINE. It incoporates arguments flexibility and this allow user not having to follow a strict format for adding a task.

Addcommand also has recurring functionality incoporated into it. This function is support for both DEADLINE and EVENT only.

If the user try recurring on a FLOATING TASKS, the system will only add it once regardless of how many time the user want the task to be added.

### Configuration
<img src="images/EditDirectly.png" width="500">  <br>
<img src="images/EditUsingLogic.png" width="500">  <br>

* Users are not recommended to edit the config file directly even if they are advanced user
* This is to prevent user from breaking the programs. Command such as freetime retrieve values found in the config file.
* If keyname in the config are changed inappropriately, taskforce will be unable to retrieve those values assign to the keyname.
* Taskforce is design to reset both config.json and savedata.xml if they do not follow the proper format (e.g keyname).
* Both new user and advanced user are encourged to use the UI, mainly config command and Cd command to modify the location of savedata or changing the setting of the taskForce.

```

### CdCommand
The Cd command enable user to check for the location of current sava data, or change the sava data location to a new path.

* Cd command will create a new savefile from scratch using the current savedata if the file does not exist in the specified path.
* If the file exist in that specified path. cd Command will overwrite the file with its current savadata stored.

#### Searching for (a) specific task(s): `find`
Finds tasks of a specific time, or whose names contain any of the given keywords.  
Format: `find METHOD/ KEYWORDS [mark/TRUE]` <br>
KEYWORDS for TYPE `name/` `desc/` `tag/` is a word that is contain/part of a task name/description/tag <br>
KEYWORDS for TYPE `day` and `week` is an integer number.

Method | Explanation | Example
-------- | :-------- | :---------
`day/` | List all events/deadline a number of days after today | `find day/ -1` (yesterday)
`week/` | List all events/deadline in a week, after current week | `find week/ 0` (current week)
`name/` | List all tasks with taskName containing the keywords | `find name/ shoes`
`tag/` | List all tasks with taskDescription containing the keywords | `find tag/ important`
`desc/` | List all tasks with the tags of task containing the keywords | `find desc/ red underwear`


> * The search is not case sensitive. e.g `task` will match `TaSK`
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `is s task` will match `task is a`
> * Sub-words will be matched e.g. `sk` will match `task`
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

> * Find command filtered out marked tasks automatically, user can turn off filter by using [mark/TRUE]
to include marked task in search
* 'find name/i wan to find marked task mark/true'


#### Searching for (a) specific task(s) under certain category: 'find'
Find tasks that belong to a certain category. <br>
Format: `find TYPE/CATEGORY` <br>
`CATEGORY` is defined as `all`, `overdue`, `mark`. Any other category will be classified
as invalid command.

Method | Explanation | Example
-------- | :-------- | :---------
'type/all' | List out every task stored in the save data | 'find type/all'
'type/overdue' | List out all deadline that are overdue and not marked | 'find type/overdue'
'type/mark' | List out all tasks that are marked done | 'find type/mark'

#### Finding free time in a specific day: `freetime`  
Gives you all the free time blocks in a specific day <br>
Format: `freetime [day/DAYS_FROM_TODAY]`  <br>

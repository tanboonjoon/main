## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>


The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskForceChangedEvent` when the TaskForce app data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` invokes the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. Upon recognizing the command, it sends the arguments to the `CommandParser` class, which recognizes the remaining arguments.
3. This information is then captured in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.  
<img src="images/DeletePersonSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the TaskForce app data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* 3 different classes of tasks implement the `ReadonyTask` interface: `Task`, the most basic form (with only ID, Name and Description), as well as `Deadline` and `Event`, which extends it.
  * Deadlines contain an endDate, Events contain a StartDate and EndDate.
* The model also holds a list of `Tags` through a `UniqueTagList`.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800">  

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TaskForce app data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

* [FAQ](#faq)
* [Command Summary](#command-summary)

## Overview

1. TaskForce allows you to manage your tasks through a simple
command-line interface (CLI)-based application.
2. It allows for 3 main kinds of tasks:  
   * Reminders - a task with no start nor end date  
   * Deadline - a task that ends at a specific time 
      > A OVERDUE TASK is a Deadline that is past today date and not marked done. 
   * Event - an event has both a start and end time
3. You can also block out time from your calendar through this app, through the
implementation of blocks - events with no name (placeholders).
4. This app is built on Java, and runs on any Desktop.

### Advanced User
1. Once you have used long the program long enough, you can use the ConfigCommand to edit the value of the confit.json
2. You are advised not to edit the config.json file directly. If it is detected as corrupted or invalidFormat, the current config.json file will be REPLACED by a default one.
3. Through the configCommand, you can change the name of the program or set your free time .

1. The recurring functionality in the addcommand is only available to Event and Deadline
2. If you tried to use recurring functionality on a Reminders, the system will only add it once.
## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `taskforce.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TaskForce app.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
   > <img src="images/taskforce_gui_3.PNG" width="600">

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`add`**` wash the toilet ` adds a reminder to wash the toilet to the task list.
   * **`search`**` d/0` searches the task list for all tasks happening today.
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
6. Many commands requires an `INDEX` which is the number associated to the task in the current list.
       > <img src = "images/index_example.png" width="600"> <br>
       > #### The index of a task is the number beside it
        
        
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>


## Features

> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `[SQUARE_BRACKETS]` are optional.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * The order of parameters are not fixed.

#### Viewing help : `help`
Displays information on how to use commands.  
Format: `help [COMMAND]`

> - If a `COMMAND` is given, help is displayed for that command only.  
> - If no `COMMAND` is given, help is displayed for all commands available.   
> - Help is not shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `help abcd`

#### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to the task list.  
Format:  
Reminder: `add TASKNAME  [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...`  
Deadline: `add TASKNAME  [d/DESCRIPTION] [et/END_DATE] [t/TAG]...`  
Event: `add TASKNAME  [d/DESCRIPTION]  [st/START_DATE] [et/END_DATE] [t/TAG]...`  

> - Tasks can have any number of tags (including 0)  
> - Date format is MM-DD-YYYY HHMM (24 hour Format) e.g. `st/ 10-22-2016 1500`
> 	- The command also supports natural language dates such as `today 6pm`
> 	- See the section [On Entering Dates](#On Entering Dates) for more details
> - If no time is specified, the time will be assumed to be the time right now.
> - If no start date is specified, it is assumed to be today.
> - If start date/time is specified but end date/time is not specified, the end date/time will be the same day on 2359.

Examples:
* `add housework d/to get pocket money t/important`<br>
* `report d/school report et/130116 2200 t/important`<br>
  Add the task into the ToDoList using `add` command.

> - The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...  
> - You can modify a reminder into a deadline/event by adding start & end dates:  
> 	 * `edit INDEX st/1700 et/1900`    
> - For tags, the edit command follows the following rules:
> 	- If the task does not have a tag specified in the edit command, the edit command shall add that tag to the task.
> 	- If the task does have a tag specified in the edit command, the edit command will remove that tag from the task.
> 	- If the task posesses some tags not specified in the edit command, they will be left unchanged by this command.

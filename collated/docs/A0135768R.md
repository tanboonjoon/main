### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`): 
Users are allowed to edit the config.json file directly such as changing the savepath or setting new activetime.
However, they are not recommended to edit/change/remove the Keyname of the config file. Doing so will result in invaliding the configuration option and the system will overwrite the current config file with a default one

This is to prevent the breaking of the system. Certain commands such as freetime will retrieve values found in config using keyname. Hence changing the keyname will break the command if the default config setting is not restored.

#### Blocking out time: `block`
Blocks out time for a potential event, or to indicate unavailability to others.  
This command can block multiple timeslots at once, all for one specific event.  
If multiple timeslots were blocked, when one timeslot is confirmed, all other timeslots are released (further explained in the <kbd>confirm</kbd> command)      

Format: `block NAME st/START_DATE et/END_DATE [st/START_DATE et/END_DATE]...`

> - Blocked out time is only blocked and cannot be tagged.  
> - Each st/ and et/ is a pair, and you can have unlimited pairs
> - Date format is MM-DD-YYYY HHMM (24 hour Format) e.g. `st/ 10-22-2016 1500`
> 	- The command also supports natural language dates such as `today 6pm`
> 	- See the section [On Entering Dates](#On Entering Dates) for more details
> - If no start time is specified, the time will be assumed to be the time right now.
> - If no start date is specified, it is assumed to be today.
> - If no end date/time is specified, the end date/time will be the same day on 2359.
> - You must have the `st/` & `et/` tag even if you use default for both date and time

Examples:
* `block meeting with boss st/1400 et/1600 st/tommorrow 1400 et/1600`
* `block study period st/1300 et/1800 st/tomorrow 2000 et/`

#### Confirming previously blocked time: `confirm`  
Confirms a blocked out time and converts it into an event  
Deletes all other blocked timeslots for the same event

Format: `confirm INDEX st/STARTTIME et/ENDTIME [d/DESCRIPTION][t/TAG]...`
> - To use this function, you must first list the desired timelot, by either going to the right date to view it, or finding it through keywords
> - Following which, you can use this command the confirm the desired slot you would like.
> - All other times associated to the previously blocked out event will be released, even if they are not in the current view.

Examples:
* `confirm 5 st/6pm et/8pm`

## On Entering Dates

TaskForce supports flexible date inputs and thus allows many natural variations of dates. The following are three broad categories of dates supported by TaskForce

### Formal Dates
> Format Dates follow the format MM-DD-YYYY HHMM <br>
> 	* 03-15-2016 1500

### Relaxed Dates
> Relaxed dates are dates that expressed months in words instead of numbers. If the year is not provided, it is assumed to be this year
> 	* Oct 20 2016
> 	* 16 Aug

### Relative dates
> Relative dates are the most natural variation of the three and supports inputs that is relative to today <br>
> 	* today 5pm
> 	* next thursday 3pm
> 	* tomorrow 9am

### UndoCommand and RedoCommand
The undo command uses the Event Driven approach in order to reduce the coupling between command classes.

Under this implementation, all commands are required to declare their changes to the TaskForce system. Since all Tasks object in the TaskForce system are immutable, a command can only add or delete a task. If a command does not add or delete a task,
the command is not undoable.

The undo command, if executed, will then simply do the opposite to the declared changes - delete what is added and add what is deleted. In this manner, the undo command does not need to know what command is executed. This also eliminates the need to implement a Undoable interface to all commands - if the command declares that it does nothing to the data, then the undo command cannot undo its actions.

Since the undo command can also be reduced to a sequence of tasks additions and deletions - needless to say, the redo command can do the same to redo any changes.

There is however a limit to how many actions the user can undo. This limit is currently set to 10. This is to limit the amount of memory used by the application during runtime and we feel 10 actions is reasonable enough to cover most use cases.

The following is the sequence diagram for a typical command executed.

<img src="images/UndoCommandLogicEvents.PNG" width="800"> <br>
> Whenever any command is exectued, an event is raised. The Model, which listens to this event will then record down the changes in a stack

<img src="images/UndoCommandLogic.PNG" width="800">  <br>
> When the undo command is executed, the undo command will call the revertChanges method in the Model which will then pop from the stack of changes and returns it to UndoCommand
> which will then undo the changes

### ConfigCommand

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level, activeTime) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):
Users are allowed to edit the config.json file directly such as changing the savepath or setting new activetime.
However, modifying the Keyname of the config file in any way is not recommended. Doing so will result in invaliding the configuration option and the system will overwrite the current config file with a default one

* Users are recommended to only interact with the config options through config command
* Setting such as activeTimes, App name, logging level can be controlled through config command
* Config command is also required in order for user to clear their sava data completely.

#### Blocking out time: `block | reserve`
Blocks out time for a potential Event.  
This command can block multiple timeslots at once, all for one specific event.  
If multiple timeslots were blocked, when one timeslot is confirmed, all other timeslots are released (further explained in the [Confirm command](#command-examples))      

Format: `block NAME st/START_DATE et/END_DATE [st/START_DATE et/END_DATE]...`

> - Blocked out time is only blocked and cannot be tagged.  
> - Each `st/START_DATE` and `et/END_DATE` is a pair, and you can have unlimited pairs. Empty datetimes are not allowed.
> - Date format is MM-DD-YYYY HHMM (24 hour Format) e.g. `st/ 10-22-2016 1500`
> 	- The command also supports natural language dates such as `today 6pm`
> 	- See the section [On Entering Dates](#On Entering Dates) for more details
> - If no start/end date is specified, it is assumed to be today on the time provided.
> - If no end date is specified, the end date will be the same day as the start date on the time provided.
> - Failing to provide any start and/or end datetime will result in a invalid command.

Examples:
* `block meeting with boss st/1400 et/1600 st/tomorrow 1400 et/1600`
* `block study period st/1300 et/1800 st/tomorrow 2000 et/2300`

#### Confirming previously blocked time: `confirm`  
Confirms a blocked out time and converts it into an event  
Deletes all other blocked timeslots for the same event

Format: `confirm INDEX st/START_TIME et/END_TIME [d/DESCRIPTION][t/TAG...]`
> - To use this function, you must first list the desired timelot by using [find command](#command-examples).
> - Following which, you can use this command to confirm your desired slot.
> - All other times associated to the previously blocked out Event will be released, even if they are not in the current view.
> - At the same time you can also change Event name, description or add additional tags.

Examples:
* `confirm 5 d/venue TBC st/6pm et/8pm t/important`

#### Deleting a task : `delete | remove` (undoable)
Deletes the specified task from the task list.
Format: `delete INDEX[, INDEX,...]`

> - Delete the task at the specified `INDEX`.
> - To delete more than one task, seperate the tasks indexes with commas.
> - The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> - The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:
* `find all/ Meeting`<br>
  `delete 1`<br>
  Deletes the *1st* task in the results of the `find` command.

#### Changing configuration options : `config`
Allows for changing of configuration options in config.json <br>
**Warning: This is for advanced users only!** <br>
Format : `config CONFG_OPTION v/NEW_VALUE` <br>
The following table are the config options and its values that is avaliable for modification by this command. <br>

Configuration Option  | Values             | Description
--------------------- | :------------------|:-----------------
taskForceDataFilePath | Use the `cd` command | The location of the data save file
userPrefsFilePath   | A file path | The location of the user preferences file
activeHoursFrom | 0000 to 2400 | The earliest hour that the freetime command would take into account when computing your freetime
activeHoursTo | 0000 to 2400 | The latest hour that the freetime command would take into account when computing your freetime
enableSudo | true or false | When enabled, you can perform the clear command and other commands for advanced users

## Date Format

TaskForce supports flexible date inputs and thus allows many natural variations of dates. The following are three broad categories of dates supported by TaskForce

### Formal Dates
> Formal Dates follow the format MM-DD-YYYY HHMM <br>
> 	* 03-15-2016 1500
> 	* 03-15-2016 0900

### Relaxed Dates
> Relaxed dates are dates that expressed months in words instead of numbers. If the year is not provided, it is assumed to be this year
> 	* Oct 20 2016 10am
> 	* 16 Aug

### Relative dates
> Relative dates are the most natural variation of the three and supports inputs that is relative to today <br>
> 	* today
> 	* next thursday 3pm
> 	* tomorrow 9am

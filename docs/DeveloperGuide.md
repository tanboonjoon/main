## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>


The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskForceChangedEvent` when the TaskForce app data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` invokes the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. Upon recognizing the command, it sends the arguments to the `CommandParser` class, which recognizes the remaining arguments.
3. This information is then captured in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.  
<img src="images/DeletePersonSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the TaskForce app data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* 3 different classes of tasks implement the `ReadonyTask` interface: `Task`, the most basic form (with only ID, Name and Description), as well as `Deadline` and `Event`, which extends it.
  * Deadlines contain an endDate, Events contain a StartDate and EndDate.
* The model also holds a list of `Tags` through a `UniqueTagList`.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800">  

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TaskForce app data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Tasks

<img src="images/TaskClass.png" width="600"><br>
Above image is a simplied class diagram of our task class 
A task is known as a TASK, FLOATING TASK or REMINDER.
A task is split into three kind, TASK, EVENT and DEADLINE
A BLOCK is treated as a EVENT

All tasks created in TaskForce are immutable. Therefore the whole program revolves around two operations - adding and deleting tasks. As such, advanced commands Such as edit command
mark command are extensions of adding and deleting Tasks.

A OVERDUE task is considered as a EVENT that has end date past today date and is not marked done


* Adding and Deleting Tasks will trigger an event to inform and update the Model side that the list is updated.
* Having commands revolve around Adding and Deleting simplify our implementation as the Model only have to listen to when Tasks are
added or deleted.
* Immutable Tasks simplify the implementation of Undo/Redo since it just the reversal of actions. Deleted task are added back and Added Task are deleted. 

### FindCommand
Our FindCommand is implemented to replace the old ListCommand found in TaskForce. ListCommand simply list out all the tasks found in 
TaskForce and this may become a problem when the list get too big. User have to scroll up and down to locate the specified tasks that they are interested. As such our FindCommand are implemented to allow users to filter out tasks in a few ways.

* Keywords Searched are filtered by TagName, Description and TaskName
* Tasks can be filtered by Event that start/end or are ongoing on a particular day. This include Deadline and Reminders.
* Tasks can also be filtered by Week, showing all the task that is due/ongoing on a particular Week defined as Monday to Friday.

Nevertheless our FindCommand is also capable of replacing ListCommand Completely through the usage of TYPE/OPTION

* A 'find type/all' will be exactly the same as what listCommand does, showing everything stored in the taskForce storage data.
* A 'find type/mark' will list out every single tasks marked done 
* A 'find type/overdue' will list out all deadline that are dued and not marked done.


### UndoCommand and RedoCommand
We have set a limit for UndoCommand to 10. Users can only undo up to 10 previous command that they have inputted while the program is 
active. Having a ceiling for UndoCommand prevent any form of huge resource hog by TaskForce and this allow Users to multitasks many 
programs with TaskForce opened at the same time.

The undo command uses the Event Driven approach in order to reduce the coupling between command classes. 

Under this implementation, all commands is required to declare their changes to the TaskForce system. Since all Tasks object in the TaskForce system are immutable, a Command can only add or delete a task. If a command does not add or delete a task,
the command is not undoable. 

The undo command, if executed, will then simply do the opposite to the declared changes - delete what is added and add what is deleted. In this manner, the undo command does not need to know what command is executed. This also eliminates the need to implement a Undoable interface to all commands - if the command declares that it does nothing to the data, then the undo command cannot undo its actions.

Since the undo command can also be reduced to a sequence of tasks additions and deletions - needless to say, the redo command can do the same to redo any changes.

The following is the sequence diagram for a typical command executed.

<img src="images/UndoCommandLogicEvents.PNG" width="800"> <br>
> Whenever any command is exectued, an event is raised. The Model, which listens to this event will then record down the changes in a stack

<img src="images/UndoCommandLogic.PNG" width="800">  <br>
> When the undo command is executed, the undo command will call the revertChanges method in the Model which will then pop from the stack of changes and returns it to UndoCommand
> which will then undo the changes

### SortedList
TaskForce wraps the ObservableList with a FilteredList, this allow Users to filter out keyword using TaskForce's FindCommand.
The FilteredList is furthur wrapped with a SortedList to ensure the list shown to Users are constantly sorted at all time.
The nature of the ObservableList allow the list shown to be constantly updated whenever a new changes occured such as Addition/Deletion of a new Tasks

### CdCommand
The CdCommand will recreate the config.json file using default Config Class as a base. The only difference is that the config.json file will contained the new savepath indicated by users. Any modification made directly to the config.json file will be overwritten when
CdCommand is used.

### AddCommand
Our Addcommand is used for adding a FLOATING TASK, EVENT and DEADLINE. It incoporates arguments flexibility and this allow user not having to follow a strict format for adding a task.

Addcommand also has recurring functionality incoporated into it. This function is support for both DEADLINE and EVENT only. 

If the user try recurring on a FLOATING TASKS, the system will only add it once regardless of how many time the user want the task to be added.

<!-- @@author A0140037W -->
### ClearCommand
The ClearCommand will erase TaskForce data and history upon executed. A confirmation dialog will appear to get user's confirmation before proceed to do the irreversable operation. 
The user can use arrow key and space bar to select the options on the confirmation dialog.

<!-- @@author A0135768R -->

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`): 
Users are allowed to edit the config.json file directly such as changing the savepath or setting new activetime.
However, they are not recommended to edit/change/remove the Keyname of the config file. Doing so will result in invaliding the configuration option and the system will overwrite the current config file with a default one

This is to prevent the breaking of the system. Certain commands such as freetime will retrieve values found in config using keyname. Hence changing the keyname will break the command if the default config setting is not restored.

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

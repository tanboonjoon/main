* This is a desktop task management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application built by a team of 4 students learning Software Engineering while using Java as
  the main programming language.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It samples the **Address Book (Level 4)** code provided as part of the module.
